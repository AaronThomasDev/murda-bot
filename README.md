# murda-bot

The main function of the bot is for "betting" a fake currency on drag races. They need to be able to bet on Lane 1 or Lane 2.

Short Term Goals:

- Give current chat users currency via a command: !givecash 100
- let them choose which lane to win and a bet ammount: !lane1 100 or !lane2 100
- winning pays out the same ammount as their bet: bet 100, get 200 back for winning

Long Term Goals:

- Fetch chat users, let them earn cash while in the channel.
- Change the payout system to a percentage?
- Betting odds system/statistics based on the ammount of bets for each lane.
